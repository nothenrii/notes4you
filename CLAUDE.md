# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a newly initialized project called "zan88keys" with minimal setup. The repository currently contains only a basic README.md file and no source code, configuration files, or build tooling has been established yet.

## Current State

- No package.json, build scripts, or dependency management configured
- No source code files present
- No testing framework or linting tools set up
- No established project structure or architecture

## Development Setup

Since this is a blank project, the development workflow will depend on what type of project this becomes (Node.js, Python, React, etc.). Future development will require:

1. Setting up a package manager and dependencies
2. Establishing a build system
3. Adding linting and formatting tools
4. Creating a testing framework
5. Defining the project architecture

This file should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established.
